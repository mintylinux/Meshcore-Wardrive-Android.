- Interactive coverage visualization
- Success rate analytics per grid square
- Repeater tracking
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds

## 📋 Requirements

- Android device with GPS
- MeshCore companion radio device
- Access to #meshwar channel (shared via QR code)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. The app connects to your MeshCore companion radio
2. As you move, it sends ping messages on the #meshwar channel
3. Repeaters that hear your ping respond with an echo
4. The app records which repeaters responded and their signal quality
5. Coverage is visualized as colored grid squares (~153m x 153m)
6. Data can be uploaded to the web map for community viewing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjustable Settings
- **Ping Interval**: 50m, 200m, 0.5 miles, or 1 mile
- **Ignore Mobile Repeater**: Filter out your own mobile repeater by prefix
- **Map Theme**: Light or dark mode
- **Color Mode**: Quality (signal strength) or Age (data freshness)

### Default Settings
- Ping interval: 0.5 miles (805 meters)
- Grid size: ~153m x 153m squares
- GPS accuracy: High
- Update frequency: Every 5 meters of movement

## 🎨 Understanding the Map

**Grid Squares** show coverage quality based on success rate:
- Multiple users' pings are aggregated per square
- Color shows: `successful pings / total pings`
- More samples = more accurate representation
- Gray squares = no ping data (GPS tracking only)

**Each square popup shows:**
- Number of samples collected
- Success rate percentage
- Received vs. lost pings
- Number of repeaters heard
- Repeater IDs (first 2 characters)

## 📖 Usage Tips

1. **Before First Use**: Join #meshwar in MeshCore app
2. **Connect Device**: Use USB for most reliable connection
3. **Enable Tracking**: Press green play button to start GPS tracking
4. **Enable Auto-Ping**: Toggle the switch to auto-ping while driving
5. **Manual Testing**: Use manual ping button to test specific locations
6. **Upload Data**: Share your findings via Settings → Upload Data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Location not updating?**
- Check GPS permissions are granted
- Enable "Location Always" for background tracking
- Press the manual location button to refresh

**Can't connect to device?**
- Check USB cable supports data transfer (not just charging)
- For Bluetooth: Make sure device is paired in Android settings first
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

**"#meshwar Not Found" error?**
- You must join #meshwar channel in MeshCore app first
- Get the QR code from another user
- Reconnect after joining the channel

**No repeater responses?**
- Verify you're in an area with repeater coverage
- Check LoRa device is connected (icon in app)
- Try manual ping to test connection

## 📊 Statistics

The top panel shows:
- **Total Samples**: Number of pings collected
- **Total Repeaters Heard**: Unique repeaters across entire map
- **Last Update**: When data was last refreshed

## 🔐 Privacy

- GPS data is only stored locally on your device
- Only uploaded to web map when you explicitly choose to upload
- No personal information is collected or transmitted
- Repeater IDs are shortened to first 2 characters on web map

## 🤝 Contributing to Coverage

Help build the community coverage map:
1. Wardrive your local area
2. Open Settings → Upload Data
3. Your samples contribute to the global success rate statistics

The more users contribute, the more accurate the coverage map becomes!
